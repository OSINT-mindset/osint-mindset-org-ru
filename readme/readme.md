# Hi there!

English version | [Русская версия](https://osint-mindset.gitbook.io/index/)

Our hobby is search: as a skill, as an art, as a way of thinking.

We are engaged in the discipline of OSINT, which is used in one way or another in many areas of our lives.

The community is named after this: `open source intelligence as a way of thinking`.

Together with like-minded people, we are developing an independent OSINT community in Russia. The **RU Telegram channel** has almost **20k** subscribers, the **Investigation Forum** has **over 4k**, about 30 people are the core of the community and are directly involved in development!
