# Hi there!

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1).png>)

Our hobby is search: as a skill, as an art, as a way of thinking.

We are engaged in the discipline of OSINT, which is used in one way or another in many areas of our lives.

The community is named after this: `open source intelligence as a way of thinking`.

Together with like-minded people, we are developing an independent OSINT community in Russia.

What are we doing:

* [1️⃣ Monthly OSINT mindset meetups in Moscow](https://osint-mindset.gitbook.io/index/mitapy-i-podkasty) (and irregular in other cities)
* [2️⃣ Podcasts and interviews about OSINT](https://osint-mindset.mave.digital/)
* [3️⃣ Developing tools for the search and processing of information](https://github.com/soxoj)
* [4️⃣ Assistance to find work in related fields](https://t.me/osint\_mindset/144)
* [5️⃣ Investigation Forum for learning OSINT on practical tasks](https://t.me/osint\_mindset/150)

Links to useful and educational materials can be found in the page menu.
